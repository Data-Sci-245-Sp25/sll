    "text": "Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with significant disparities in outcomes across racial and ethnic groups (CDC 2023). While overall cancer mortality has declined since the turn of the century, these improvements have not been equally distributed across populations, creating a critical publish health equity challenge.\nThese disparities are shaped by structural racism and a multitude of socioeconomic and environmental factors, including unequal access to timely care and differences in insurance coverage (Jack and Mitchell 2023). Historical patterns of discrimination have created enduring disparities that manifest in cancer screening rates, stage at diagnosis, treatment quality, and survival outcomes.\nBlack Americans experience the highest overall cancer death rates among all racial and ethnic groups, with particular disparities when it comes to prostate and colorectal cancers (CDC 2025). For example, Black men have a prostate cancer mortality rate nearly twice that of their white counterparts, despite similar incidence rates. This disparity suggests critical differences between races and ethnicities regarding early detection, access to treatment, and quality of care.\nNative American and Alaska Native populations have seen increasing mortality rates for several cancer types, particularly lung, colorectal, liver, stomach, and kidney cancers (Jack and Mitchell). Indigenous populations often face additional barriers to care, namely geographic isolation and a lack of specialized cancer treatment centers that utilize culturally appropriate care models.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD \n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD For example, Black Americans experience the highest cancer death rates, particularly for prostate and colo-rectal cancers ([CDC 2025] (https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/health-equity/african-american.html)).

This severely influences the survival rates of cancer for Hispanic people; an increasingly bleak fact when paired with the fact that about 30% of Hispanics will be diagnosed with cancer within their lifetime.\nDespite growing awareness of the relationship between cancer deaths and race/ethnicity, the public health literature remains limited in its exploration of how these disparities vary at local levels. Regional differences in healthcare infrastructure, environmental exposures, cultural factors, and demographic composition work together to create unique patterns of cancer disparities that may not be captured in nationally aggregated analyses. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5ec9f92f9c3cde44f202c4d0b29477de5941264a\nPlace-based disparities interact with racial and ethnic variables in complex ways that necessitate more granular analysis to comprehend and address.

This research aims to examine the relationship between race/ethnicity and cancer-related deaths in the Multnomah county, with the goal of identifying persistent gaps in outcomes.\nRecent trends in national cancer rates have revealed that the cases of cancer in people with a white, non-Hispanic identity have increased, however this does not reflect the mortality rate of these instances.\n\n\nThis study aims to examine the relationship between race/ethnicity and cancer-related deaths in Multnomah County, Oregon, to identify persistent gaps in outcomes. This approach, focusing on county-level race/ethnicity data, provides valuable insights for healthcare providers, public health officials, and community organizations so we can achieve better cancer health equity in Multnomah County. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5ec9f92f9c3cde44f202c4d0b29477de5941264a",

    "text": "Abstract..\nThis project analyzes cancer mortality data from Multnomah County, focusing on how the top three causes of cancer-related deaths have varied across racial and ethnic groups over the past ten years. Race and ethnicity were selected as key variables due to their deep connections with structural factors such as geographic location, access to care, and economic status. Historically, communities of color in Multnomah County have been disproportionately impacted by health inequities stemming from systemic discrimination. By centering these populations in our analysis, this research aims to bring visibility to patterns of disparity that are often underrepresented in public health data. The findings from this study are intended to support the Multnomah County Health Department in developing more informed, equitable, and community-responsive health policies moving forward.",

By identifying patterns and disparities in cancer mortality, this study seeks to understand how structural inequalities, such as access to healthcare and historical discrimination, may contribute to unequal health outcomes. We have centered our core variables to race and ethnicity to be able to move beyond surface-level data and instead focus on the lived experiences of communities that have often been excluded from dominant health narratives. Ultimately, this research aims to inform more inclusive public health strategies and contribute to ongoing efforts toward health equity and justice.",
