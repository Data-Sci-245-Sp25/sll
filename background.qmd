Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with significant disparities in outcomes across racial and ethnic groups ([CDC 2023](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/topics/cancer-deaths.htm)). While overall cancer mortality has started to decline since the turn of the century, these improvements have not been equitably distributed.

For example, Black Americans experience the highest cancer death rates, particularly for prostate and colo-rectal cancers (\[CDC 2025\] (https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/health-equity/african-american.html)). Additionally, while Native American and Alaska Native populations have seen increasing mortality rates for some cancer typesâ€”particularly lung, colo-rectal, liver, stomach, and kidney cancers ([Jack and Mitchell 2023](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/collections/pdf/racism_is_a_public_health_crisis_combating_racism_508.pdf)).

These disparities are shaped by a structural racism and a multitude of environmental disparities, including unequal access to timely care and differences in insurance coverage ([Jack and Mitchell](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/collections/pdf/racism_is_a_public_health_crisis_combating_racism_508.pdf)).

Despite growing awareness of the relationship between cancer deaths and race, the public health literature remains limited in its exploration of how these disparities vary at local levels. This research aims to examine the relationship between race/ethnicity and cancer-related deaths in the Multnomah county, with the goal of identifying persistent gaps in outcomes.

Recent trends in national cancer rates have revealed that the cases of cancer in people with a white, non-Hispanic identity have increased, however this does *not* reflect the mortality rate of these instances.
